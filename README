Repository for the "hello world" Anaconda addon. It is supposed to be as simple
as possible to not disturb user (addon developer) from important things. In
the same time it should demonstrate Anaconda's API and functionality provided
for addons.

For information on developing addons see: https://rhinstaller.github.io/anaconda-addon-development-guide/
